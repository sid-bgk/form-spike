# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds multi-select functionality to the dynamic form system to handle fields where users can select multiple options from a predefined list. The specific use case is for the "Source of Income" field where users can select multiple income sources like "Salary or Wages", "Business Owner or Self Employed", and "Other Sources".

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a form user, I want to select multiple options from a list of choices, so that I can accurately represent scenarios where multiple selections are valid (like having multiple income sources).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a field has type "multi" THEN the system SHALL render a multi-select component
2. WHEN a user clicks on an option THEN the system SHALL toggle the selection state of that option
3. WHEN multiple options are selected THEN the system SHALL store all selected values as an array
4. WHEN no options are selected THEN the system SHALL store an empty array as the field value
5. WHEN the field is required and no options are selected THEN the system SHALL display a validation error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a form developer, I want to configure multi-select fields using the same field configuration pattern, so that I can easily add multi-select fields to any form.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining a field with type "multi" THEN the system SHALL accept an options array with value and label properties
2. WHEN validation rules are specified THEN the system SHALL apply validation to the selected array
3. WHEN the field has a label THEN the system SHALL display the label above the multi-select component
4. WHEN the field is marked as required THEN the system SHALL show a required indicator (*)
5. WHEN the field has a description THEN the system SHALL display the description below the component

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a form user, I want the multi-select component to have a clear visual design, so that I can easily understand which options are selected and interact with the component intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an option is selected THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the selected state (checkmark, different background, etc.)
2. WHEN an option is not selected THEN the system SHALL show the unselected state clearly
3. WHEN hovering over an option THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback
4. WHEN the component is disabled THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the disabled state and prevent interactions
5. WHEN there are many options THEN the system SHALL maintain a readable layout without overwhelming the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a form developer, I want multi-select fields to integrate seamlessly with the existing validation system, so that I can apply standard validation rules like required, minItems, and maxItems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a multi-select field is required and empty THEN the system SHALL show the configured required validation message
2. WHEN minItems validation is configured and fewer items are selected THEN the system SHALL show a validation error
3. WHEN maxItems validation is configured and more items are selected THEN the system SHALL show a validation error
4. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL display them in the same format as other field types
5. WHEN the field becomes valid THEN the system SHALL clear validation errors automatically

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a form user, I want multi-select fields to work with conditional visibility, so that multi-select fields can be shown or hidden based on other form values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a multi-select field has conditions and they evaluate to false THEN the system SHALL hide the field
2. WHEN a multi-select field becomes hidden THEN the system SHALL clear its selected values
3. WHEN a multi-select field becomes visible THEN the system SHALL show it with no pre-selected values (unless default values are configured)
4. WHEN form values change THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate multi-select field visibility conditions
5. WHEN a hidden multi-select field has validation errors THEN the system SHALL clear those errors
