# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dynamic form system has an issue where array fields configured in the backend are not rendering properly on the frontend. The backend configuration specifies `type: "array"` with `arrayItemFields` for company information, but the frontend only shows a single company name field without the ability to add or remove companies. This requirement document outlines the necessary fixes to ensure array fields function correctly with proper add/remove functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user filling out a registration form, I want to be able to add multiple companies to my work history, so that I can provide complete employment information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the form loads with an array field configuration THEN the system SHALL render an array field component with add/remove functionality
2. WHEN the array field has `minItems: 1` THEN the system SHALL initialize with at least one empty item
3. WHEN I click the "Add Another Company" button THEN the system SHALL add a new set of company fields
4. WHEN I click the remove button on a company item THEN the system SHALL remove that specific company item
5. WHEN the array has reached `maxItems: 5` THEN the system SHALL disable the add button
6. WHEN the array has only the minimum number of items THEN the system SHALL disable remove buttons

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the array field to respect conditional visibility rules, so that company information only appears when I indicate I am working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `areYouWorking` field is set to "no" THEN the system SHALL hide the companies array field
2. WHEN the `areYouWorking` field is set to "yes" THEN the system SHALL show the companies array field
3. WHEN the companies field becomes visible THEN the system SHALL initialize with one empty company item
4. WHEN the companies field becomes hidden THEN the system SHALL clear the array data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and validation for array fields, so that users receive clear feedback about required fields and validation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an array item field is required and empty THEN the system SHALL display a validation error
2. WHEN array validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent form submission
3. WHEN the array has fewer than `minItems` THEN the system SHALL display a validation error
4. WHEN individual array item fields have validation errors THEN the system SHALL display errors next to the specific fields

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the array field data to be properly submitted with the form, so that my company information is saved correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit the form with multiple companies THEN the system SHALL include all company data in the submission
2. WHEN array fields are conditionally hidden THEN the system SHALL exclude their data from submission
3. WHEN the form is reset THEN the system SHALL reset array fields to their initial state
4. WHEN array data is submitted THEN the system SHALL maintain the proper structure with all arrayItemFields
