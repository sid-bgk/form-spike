# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current form validation system only supports basic required field validation with hardcoded error messages. This enhancement will introduce a flexible validation system that allows multiple validation rules per field with custom error messages, making the form system more robust and user-friendly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a form developer, I want to define multiple validation rules for a single field with custom error messages, so that I can provide specific and helpful feedback to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a field configuration contains a validation object THEN the system SHALL support multiple validation rules within that object
2. WHEN a validation object contains a "required" key THEN the system SHALL treat the field as required and use the provided custom message
3. WHEN a validation object contains an "email" key THEN the system SHALL validate email format and use the provided custom message
4. WHEN a validation object contains a "minLength" key THEN the system SHALL validate minimum character length and use the provided custom message
5. WHEN a validation object contains a "maxLength" key THEN the system SHALL validate maximum character length and use the provided custom message
6. WHEN a validation object contains a "pattern" key THEN the system SHALL validate against the provided regex pattern and use the provided custom message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a form developer, I want to maintain backward compatibility with the existing required boolean property, so that existing forms continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a field configuration uses "required: true" THEN the system SHALL continue to work with default error messages
2. WHEN a field configuration uses both "required" boolean and "validation" object THEN the system SHALL prioritize the validation object
3. WHEN migrating from boolean required to validation object THEN existing functionality SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a form developer, I want to define validation rules for different field types (text, email, number, etc.), so that I can ensure data integrity across all form inputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a text field has validation rules THEN the system SHALL apply text-specific validations (minLength, maxLength, pattern)
2. WHEN an email field has validation rules THEN the system SHALL apply email format validation in addition to other rules
3. WHEN a number field has validation rules THEN the system SHALL apply number-specific validations (min, max, integer)
4. WHEN an array field has validation rules THEN the system SHALL apply array-specific validations (minItems, maxItems)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a form user, I want to see specific and helpful error messages when validation fails, so that I understand exactly what needs to be corrected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation fails for a field THEN the system SHALL display the custom error message defined in the validation object
2. WHEN multiple validation rules fail for a field THEN the system SHALL display the first applicable error message
3. WHEN a field becomes valid after being invalid THEN the system SHALL clear the error message immediately
4. WHEN a conditional field becomes hidden THEN the system SHALL clear any validation errors for that field

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a form developer, I want the validation system to work seamlessly with conditional fields, so that hidden fields don't trigger validation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conditional field is hidden THEN the system SHALL not validate that field
2. WHEN a conditional field becomes visible THEN the system SHALL apply validation rules immediately
3. WHEN a conditional field becomes hidden THEN the system SHALL clear the field value and validation state
4. WHEN form values change affecting field visibility THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate validation for all affected fields
