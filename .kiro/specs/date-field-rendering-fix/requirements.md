# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dynamic form system has a critical issue where date fields configured in the backend are not rendering on the frontend. The backend configuration specifies `type: "date"` for the date of birth field with proper validation and date constraints, but the frontend DynamicField component lacks support for rendering date input fields. This results in date fields being completely invisible to users, preventing form completion.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user filling out a registration form, I want to see and interact with date fields, so that I can enter my date of birth and other date information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a field configuration has `type: "date"` THEN the system SHALL render a date input field
2. WHEN the date field is rendered THEN the system SHALL use the shadcn date component if available, otherwise fall back to HTML5 date input type
3. WHEN the date field has a label THEN the system SHALL display the label with required indicator if applicable
4. WHEN the date field has placeholder text THEN the system SHALL display appropriate placeholder text
5. WHEN the date field is disabled THEN the system SHALL render the field in a disabled state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want date fields to respect validation rules and constraints, so that I can only enter valid dates within acceptable ranges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a date field has `minDate` constraint THEN the system SHALL prevent selection of dates before the minimum date
2. WHEN a date field has `maxDate` constraint THEN the system SHALL prevent selection of dates after the maximum date
3. WHEN a date field is required THEN the system SHALL validate that a date value is provided
4. WHEN date validation fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN a valid date is entered THEN the system SHALL clear any previous validation errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want date fields to handle default values properly, so that forms can be pre-populated with sensible date defaults.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a date field has a `defaultValue` THEN the system SHALL initialize the field with that date
2. WHEN the default value is a Date object THEN the system SHALL convert it to the proper format for HTML5 date inputs (YYYY-MM-DD)
3. WHEN the default value is an ISO string THEN the system SHALL extract the date portion for display
4. WHEN no default value is provided THEN the system SHALL initialize with an empty date field

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want date fields to integrate seamlessly with the existing form validation system, so that date validation works consistently with other field types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN date field validation is processed THEN the system SHALL use the existing validation framework
2. WHEN date fields have conditional visibility THEN the system SHALL show/hide date fields based on form logic
3. WHEN date field values change THEN the system SHALL trigger form validation and update form state
4. WHEN date fields are part of multi-step forms THEN the system SHALL maintain date values across step navigation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want date fields to provide a good user experience across different devices and browsers, so that I can easily enter dates regardless of my platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the shadcn date component THEN the system SHALL provide a consistent, styled date picker interface
2. WHEN the date field receives focus THEN the system SHALL show appropriate input assistance
3. WHEN date values are displayed THEN the system SHALL format them in a user-friendly manner
4. WHEN date fields are validated THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
